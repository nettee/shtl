This is a project constructed by myself, now mainly written in Python, maybe in the future I will rewrite them into C.
I plan to write several programs to simulate Unix tools, especially those meant to deal with text and data, like cat, wc, sort, grep, uniq, sed, etc. I write these programs mainly to practise how to write medium-length programs. Although the things I already have done (echo and cat) are absolutely small programs, but gradually I can write some more complicated ones.
The most complex works may be command-line arguments parsing, however, I have a modern standard library argparse, which is a fabulous tool for parsing arguments. This describes why I use Python, I hope to focus on the most basic work, not to be comfused by trifles like command-line arguments. Later if I gain enough experience in C programming, I will rewrite every program.
Obviously my program is far from mature, it just record the way of my learning, I will become more hardworking.
